## GPG Keys

I use [GnuPG](https://gnupg.com) with separate subkeys for signing,
authentication and encryption, certified by the following master key:

```
pub   rsa4096/0x8767471E3CEC993D 2023-03-13 [C]
      Key fingerprint = 3FDE 70BA 93DD 41CB BFC8  974D 8767 471E 3CEC 993D
uid                   [ultimate] Barry Wasdell <barry@bwsd.dev>
```

To import public keys belonging to me, use the following command:

```bash
$ gpg2 --locate-keys barry@bwsd.dev
```

This will lookup public keys from [bwsd.dev](https://bwsd.dev) using the Web Key
Directory (WKD) protocol.

### Encryption Key
